                <li><strong>• 1941 -</strong> Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is
                    rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,

                    Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the

                    dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for
                    a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best
                    breeds.".</li>
